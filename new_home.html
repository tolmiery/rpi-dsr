            <p>
              The Disabled Students at RPI (DSR) is a group dedicated to advocating for accessibility on campus. We use the term "disabled" as an inclusive term that encompasses individuals with physical, mental, or developmental disabilities; chronic illnesses; neurodivergence; or any health condition that presents challenges in daily college life. Even if you don't identify as disabled, this club may still be for you! 
              <br><br>
              Being a college student with health problems can feel very lonely, so this club was created to bring students together and show that there are others out there like you. Our club is first and foremost a judgement-free zone for those with health challenges. While you do not need to have a health problem to join the DSR, we do ask that you remain respectful of those who do and refrain from any hateful comments.
              <br><br><br>
              If you're specifically interested in autism-centered discussions, check out the Autism at RPI Club (ARC) â€” of course, you're welcome to join both clubs.
