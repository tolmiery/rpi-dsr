# Disabled Students @RPI Website

The DSR Website project team aims to create a fully accessible site to be utilized by the Disabled Students at RPI club. Through this site, students will be able to see club information in one convenient location, and will have access to additional resources regarding disability accommodations and accessibility on the RPI campus.
