      </div>

      <div class="container">

      <div class="container">
            <h2 class="sub-title">Requesting Accommodations</h2>
            <p>The steps for requesting initial accommodations are:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Complete an <a href="https://rpi.app.box.com/s/wu14pgjgpnsi7afnl5b7m6vbibc3n5u1"><strong>accommodations request form</strong></a>.</li>
              <li>Acquire documentation of your disability from your doctor.</li>
              <li>Submit all documentation, along with your request form, to Disability Student Services. Claire Mahoney, the director of DSS, is reachable at <a href="mailto:dss@rpi.edu">dss@rpi.edu</a> or <a href="mailto:mahonc6@rpi.edu">mahonc6@rpi.edu</a>.</li>
              <li>Meet with Claire to discuss your accommodations and how to alert your professors.</li>
              <li>After meeting with Claire, she will send you an accommodations memo outlining your approved accommodations. Distribute your memo to your professors and meet with them to discuss logistics.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>It's best practice to distribute your memo at the beginning of the semester. Those with testing accommodations should make sure to distribute their memos at least a week before their first exam.</p>

            <p>Each academic year, you will be required to renew your accommodations. The process is:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Complete the <a href="https://rpi.app.box.com/s/wu14pgjgpnsi7afnl5b7m6vbibc3n5u1"><strong>accommodations request form</strong></a> and note any changes to your previous accommodations.</li>
              <li>If your documentation has gone out-of-date, you may be asked to send up-to-date documentation. Likewise, you may need to submit new documentation to support new accommodations.</li>
              <li>Claire will send you an accommodations memo outlining your approved accommodations. The distribution process is the same as for an initial accommodations memo.</li>
            </ol>
